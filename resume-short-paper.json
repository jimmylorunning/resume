    "summary": "As early as I can remember, I've been a tinkerer, builder, and techie. At Georgia Tech, I studied computer science and went on to work for several design and web development firms. Most recently, I worked at the DeKalb Library as their in-house programmer, responsible for all facets of their online presence and internal operations. Currently, I'm looking for new technical challenges and a work environment where I can grow. I value good design, elegant code, and learning new things.
