    "summary": "Jimmy has been a tech geek ever since programming the Apple IIe in high school. He went on to study computer science at Georgia Tech and working for several design and web development firms. Most recently he has worked at the DeKalb Library as their in-house programmer, responsible for all facets of their online presence. While that was fun, he cannot wait to branch out and work in a team environment again. He values good design, good code, and learning new things. You can read about what he's been learning lately at his blog, jimmylocoding.com or watch his projects on github.com/jimmylorunning.",
